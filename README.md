# Island Xtreme Stunts Widescreen Tool
by Jeff

This program applies a resolution and aspect ratio hack to the PC version of Island Xtreme Stunts.
To use: Extract into the game's install location. Run as an administrator.

This program will create a backup of your game file before modifying it. To revert all changes, delete your Game.exe and remove the ".bak" from your Game.exe.bak file.

Known Issues:
- This only works with the 2nd version of the game (the one that works on modern computers.) If you have the other version get the patch here: http://w11.zetaboards.com/GreenRedBrick/topic/8914493/1/
- Changing the resolution does not (yet?) scale the HUD. It will stay in the center of the screen. A work-around is to use one of the default resolutions, set your custom aspect ratio and make your monitor stretch the image manually.
